# JQMCore
A collection of core helper functions for PowerShell.  Requires PowerShell v3.0.

To use these routines, you can do one of the following:
1.  Copy the JQMCore folder and its contents into your PowerShell modules folder.  You can see which
    folders these are by looking at the PSModulePath environment variable.

-OR-

2.  Create a new folder on your system named "JQMModules" or something to that effect, then copy the
    JQMCore folder into this folder.  Add the path of the "JQMModules" folder to the PSModulePath
    environment variable.
